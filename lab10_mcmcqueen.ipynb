    "\n",
    "2.Why don't some inference algorithms explore both modes of the density?\n",

    "\n",
    "3.Why do some algorithms stay in the same state repeatedly?\n",

    "Answer: m = 1, I tried lots of values and none worked as well as 1,\n",
    "Timestep = 100. It works well because at 100 your values are not dependent on those before it. They are also given time to explore and taking samples then. But it's not too much that it goes too far or it takes 50000000 years. \n",
